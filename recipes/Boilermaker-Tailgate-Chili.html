    <h1>Boilermaker Tailgate Chili</h1>

    <p>This boilermaker chili recipe is the one the gang eats at Purdue Boilermaker football games. I always prep and
        cook the chili the night before and then reheat it the next day. This is a combination of many different
        tomato-based chili recipes.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 (15 ounce) cans chili beans, drained</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chili beans in spicy sauce</li>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with juice</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Crumble ground chuck and sausage into the hot pan. Cook,
            stirring frequently, until meat is evenly browned. Drain off excess grease.</li>
        <li>Pour in chili beans, spicy chili beans, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste. Add celery, onion, bell peppers,
            chile peppers, bacon bits, bouillon, beer, 1/4 cup chili powder, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, oregano,
            cumin, hot pepper sauce, basil, cayenne, paprika, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Stir
            to blend, then cover and simmer over low heat for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Taste and season with more salt, pepper, and chili powder if necessary. The longer the chili simmers, the
            better it will taste. Remove from the heat and serve, or cool, refrigerate, and reheat the next day.</li>
